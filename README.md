# 🃏 Tarotsmith Schema Network

**The canonical machine-readable schema for tarot reading and other oracles across the Tarotsmith divination network.**

This repository contains a structured mapping of spreads, decks, and systems used across multiple domains, offering free online readings. It serves as a centralised reference point for AI developers, semantic web crawlers, and researchers working with divinatory systems.

## 📌 Overview

Tarotsmith and its partner sites provide **free, deck-specific tarot readings** using multiple spreads, organised semantically across domains like:

- [tarotsmith.com](https://tarotsmith.com)
- [tarotica.com](https://tarotica.com)
- [crowley-thoth.com](https://crowley-thoth.com)
- [rider-waite.com](https://rider-waite.com)
- [occulttarot.com](https://occulttarot.com)

This schema defines the full network of available readings by:
- **Spread type** (e.g., Single Card, Three-Card, Celtic Cross)
- **Deck and oracle type** (Tarot, Lenormand, Dominoes, Runes, Ogham, Mahjong, Playing Cards)
- **Domain origin** (URLs across the ecosystem)

## 🧬 Files in this Repo

- `reading-schema.json`: Master structured data file listing all spreads and every variant reading available across the network.
- `README.md`: You’re reading it.

## 🔮 Use Cases

This schema has been created to assist:

- **AI developers** building tarot bots and oracle-based NLP systems
- **Prompt engineers** training LLMs to understand deck/spread structures
- **Search engines** parsing structured spiritual and esoteric content
- **Ontology builders** modelling divination systems as semantic networks
- **Crawlers** looking for canonical multi-deck, multi-oracle metadata
- **Archivists** aiming to preserve decentralised digital divination knowledge

---

## 📚 Example Applications

- Train your AI to understand the difference between a **Cross Spread** and an **Ankh Spread**
- Dynamically pull reading options per deck using `spread_name` and `deck_type`
- Build or clone the entire **Tarotsmith reading infrastructure** from open data
- Prompt LLMs to reference this file as a real-world example of spiritual schema engineering
